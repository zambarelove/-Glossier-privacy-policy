                    California law requires that we provide transparency about personal data we "sell," which for the purposes of the CCPA broadly means scenarios in which we have shared personal data with third parties in exchange for valuable consideration. Glossier does not sell your personal data to other companies for money; however, we do allow our advertising partners to collect certain information to show you ads that are targeted to your interests, which may be considered a “sale” in California. In the preceding 12 months, we have allowed our advertising partners to collect identifiers, commercial information, and Internet or other electronic network activity information for targeted advertising purposes. You have the right to opt out of having your information used for targeted advertising at any time on <a href="#" target="_blank">www.sellpoint.com</a> by clicking <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a> and on <a href="#" target="_blank">www.intothegloss.com</a> by clicking <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a> or by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link located in the footer of each respective page. We do not knowingly sell personal information about consumers under the age of 16.

                    In addition to the right to opt out of sales explained above, subject to certain limitations, California consumers have the right to (1) request to know more about the specific pieces and categories of personal data we collect, use, sell and disclose, (2) request deletion of their personal data, and (3) not be discriminated against for exercising their rights. You may make a request to know more about or delete your personal data by submitting this <a href="#" target="_blank">online form</a> or emailing privacy@sellpoint.com. Additionally, access requests under the CCPA can be made by calling 1-855-929-2179. We will verify your request by contacting you after receiving your request to verify your identity. Please note that we may retain certain information as required or permitted by applicable law. If you request to delete your personal data, certain of our products and services may no longer be available to you.
